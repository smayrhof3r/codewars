# codewars
This is my repository for storing challenges I complete on codewars (username: goldilocs)

Currently I'm practicing Ruby and Javascript

Originally my focus was on 'clever' solutions, but as I'm learning more about best practice, I'm shifting my focus to 'readability'
I want to be writing code that's easy to understand!
